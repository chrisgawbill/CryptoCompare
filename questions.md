1) The only sub optimal choice is that I did not use any frontend framework. I used plain HTML, CSS, JS because that is what I know best and know I can get work done quickly using
    that. 
2) The only part that is purposefully overdesigned is the way I display the information. The way I could have done it to make it easier and quicker is to have
    html placeholders inside the #content_div. But instead I decided to do it through JS by manipulating the DOM just to show that I know how the DOM works
    and I know how to easily manipulate it to add different elements.
3) I would not make any changes right now. I feel like my solution would be able to handle 100 users. 
4) I would have included more exchange APIs in the backend so the user would be able to compare different exchanges to each other. I would also expand the list of coins that a user 
    could look up the prices for.
